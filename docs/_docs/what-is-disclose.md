# What is disclose.io?

Disclose.io is a cross-industry, vendor-agnostic standardization project for safe harbor best practices to enable good-faith security research.

With the help of expert maintainers and by harnessing the power of open-source, disclose.io provides:

-   Free boilerplate policies, tools, and data-sets to establish and improve vulnerabilty disclosure programs,
-   A straight-forward maturity model and easily recognizable seal for those taking part in “Neighbourhood Watch for the Internet”, and
-   Centralized information, community assistance, activism, advocacy for security researchers and those wanting to report security issues.
